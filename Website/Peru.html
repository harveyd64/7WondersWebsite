	<th>Machu Picchu is thought to have been a royal or religious area for the Inca Empire, before their civilisation was wiped out by Spanish Invaders (during the 16th Century). Until 1911, the citadel was a secret area, but was discovered by Hiram Bingham, an archaeologist.</th>
	<th>Machu Picchu is located on a 2430 metre tall mountain ridge known as Andes Mountains, in Peru. It's above the Urubamba River Valley. It is about 50 miles away from Gusco. It is suggested that a smallpox epidemic in the area caused the desertion of Machu Picchu.</th>
	<th>It is believed to have been built during the peak of the Inca Empire, around the 15th Century. It is possible that it was built for Inca emperor Pachacuti, who lived between 1438-1472. It was abandoned about 100 years after its construction.</th>
