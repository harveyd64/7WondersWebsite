	<th>This pyramid is part of a complex known as the Giza Necropolis. Built at about 480 feet tall, the Great Pyramid of Giza is covered in stones to form a smooth surface. Originally, it was covered with white limestone to reflect the sun, however this was removed to build other structures.</th>
	<th>Located near the Khafre Pyramid and the Menkaure Pyramid, The Great Pyramid of Giza is based about 5 miles away from the River Nile and is close to Cairo in Egypt. The structure covers about 13 acres of land. </th>
	<th>The oldest of the Wonders, the Great Pyramid began construction about 2580 BC and completed construction about 20 years after. It was built for the pharaoh Khufu and held all the treasures he had in his life. The Pyramid was likely looted at some point since no treasures remain.</th>
